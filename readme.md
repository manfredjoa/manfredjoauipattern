Welcome to my UI Pattern Project!  
  
For my [project](https://manfredjoa.github.io/manfredjoauipattern/), I decided to do the modal pattern, which was challenging but a lot of fun! Even though this looked like the most complicated and difficult one, I knew I had to do this one because of how organized and modern it looks.

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project.

I love color and wanted to have some fun, so for my API I decided on the Fruityvice API, found
[here](https://www.fruityvice.com/).

The API unfortunately does not provide any photos, so I found the photos courtesy of Google, and all the cool information about each fruit comes from the API.

I wanted the webpage to be easy to use, so all you have to do is click on a fruit for its modal to pop up. To close the modal, I've provided a couple different options. You can click the 'x' button in the top right corner, or click anywhere outside of the modal, or press your 'esc' key on your keyboard.

Enjoy!
